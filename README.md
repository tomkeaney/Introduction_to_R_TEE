# Introduction_to_R_TEE
This site hosts all the files you need to generate Tom's getting started with R workshop in JGU's Theoretical Evolutionary Ecology module. The lectures were written in quarto (the `.qmd` files) and built into presentation form with the [Reavealjs integration](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) (the `docs/.html` files). Each lecture has a double with the `.student` suffix. Throughout the lectures, I have sections where I ask the students to solve a coding problem. The `.student` files have had all answers removed and thus can be distirbuted to students prior to the workshop. 

I use [Hone and Habib's (2024)](https://peerj.com/articles/17524/) dataset on Pterosaur morphology to practice data-wrangling. The data are housed [here](https://peerj.com/articles/17524/#supp-1), but I also provide a slightly tidied version in this repo for convenience (`pterosaur_data.csv`). Do make sure to give them the appropriate credit.
